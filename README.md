# Devcon Machine Learning Workshop

Requirements:
  * Basic Knowledge of Linear Algebra
  * Basic Knowledge of Calculus
  * IDE/Text editor
  * Python 3
  * Tensorflow version 1.2
  * Keras 2.0 above



Don't worry if you don't meet all requirements above :) 

### TBD

Before we start, lets setup all the required libraries
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Install Tensorflow
www.tensorflow.com

Agenda:
TBD

```
jupyter notebook 
```

Here is an overview of what we are going to cover:

-  Installing the Python and required libraries.
-  Loading the dataset.
-  Summarizing the dataset.
-  Visualizing the dataset.
-  Evaluating some algorithms.
-  Making some predictions.

A machine learning project may not be linear, but it has a number of well known steps:

1. Define Problem.
2. Prepare Data.
3. Evaluate Algorithms.
4. Improve Results.
5. Present Results.
